# Unscramble Computer Science Problems

A Jupyter Notebook uses Python to investigate a simple data set. The runtime complexity of each step in the solution is analyzed and discussed, created as part of the [Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256).
