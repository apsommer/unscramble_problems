# Unscramble Computer Science Problems

Python logic is discussed in a Jupyter Notebook to investigate a sample data set. The runtime complexity of each solution step is analyzed, created as part of the [Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256).
